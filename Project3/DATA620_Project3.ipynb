    "In the end, we created a Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the gender of a given name from our Names corpus. With a robust corpus of 7944 names, we randomized and split the data into a test set of 500 names (for final testing of our model), a development test set of 500 names to utilize while tweaking and adjusting our model features, and a training set that we used throughout to train our model -- which contained 6944 names.\n",

    "##### Identifying the most informative features and creating our classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "After several runs of our Naive Bayes Classifier, we were able to pinpoint some of the most informative features:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ the value of the first and last few letters of a given name\n",
    "+ the number of vowels present in a given name\n",
    "+ the presence of double letters (i.e. \"ee\", \"oo\", etc.) in a given name\n",
    "+ the length of a given name\n",
    "+ the number of consonants in a given name\n",
    "+ and the presence of certain letters in a given name (based on research, some letters seemed to be present more frequently in male or female names)\n",
    "\n",
    "With our features identified, we were able to use our final classifier on our test set of 500 names. We found that our classifier, and these features were able to successfully predict the gender of about 80% of the names in our test corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Evaluating the performance of our classifier and resampling our training dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this was interesting, we did realize that there was an unequal distribution of male and female names present in our Names corpus, and thus found that the prediction accuracy was slightly higher for females than for males in our final evaluation. We can attribute this to the fact that the model had more female names to train on, which ultimately led to a slightly better performance when we subjected it to our final test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate this further, we decided to retrain our model in two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) We **undersampled the female names** in our training set in order to create a more equal proportion of female/male names for our classifier to determine patterns from -- to do this, we randomly removed about 2000 female names from our training data\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We **oversampled the male names** in our training set in order to match the number of female names -- to do this, we randomly copied about 2000 male names to match the number of female names present in the training data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary of our findings\n",
    "\n",
    "After training our data with these new splits, we then subjected this new classifier on our test data and found that the overall performance decreased slightly (by about 1%). As we can see from the summary tables, both approaches to balancing the training dataset reduced the accuracy of predicting female names, but increased that of predicting male names. This was to be expected since the resampled training data and the corresponding algorithm had fewer female names to determine patterns from, leading to less accurate predictions. However, this in turn increased the relative impact of the male-predictor patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, we were able to implement a Naive Bayes Classifier and Maximum Entropy Classifier on our names corpus, and after conducting a few different sampling techniques, we generated a classifier that preformed quite well (~80% accuracy predicting female and male names)."
