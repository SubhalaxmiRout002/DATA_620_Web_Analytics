    "Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this analysis. A guiding question or hypothesis to test is one good way to start. If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), you should also list your partners’ names. \n",

    "## The Proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of our project will be a form of sentiment analysis on Tweets related to Covid-19. We will first scrape Tweets from a particular location using Covid-related hashtags, evaluate overall sentiment within these Tweets and then compare that to data on the number and severity of Coronavirus cases at that location. The goal is to investigate any potential relationship between Tweet sentiment and Covid-19 cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "The overall sentiment may reflect reactions to the number of cases, in which case it would largely be inversely proportional to the number of cases. The relationship is, however, likely much more complex than that. There are states in the US that are experiencing recent rapid rises in the number of cases (likely due to easing of restrictions). In places like this sentiment may trend more positively as the residents see restrictions easing, while the result is actually a rapid rise in case number. In this instance the positive setiment may be reflective of behavior that would actually lead to more Coronavirus cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to look at these trends in various locations and specifically focus on key moments such as changes in the official enforcement of social-distancing and announcements by government agencies to study the relationship between Tweet sentiment and number of Covid-19 cases. "

    "2. **Coronavirus Case Numbers & Events** - *Subha Rout* will be responsible for pulling the coronavirus case numbers by day as well as location-specific events. \n",
    "3. **Sentiment Analysis** - *Amber Ferger* will be responsible for analyzing the sentiment of the tweets. \n",
    "4. **Visualization** - *Zach Alexander* will be responsible for visualizing the data. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Sentiment analysis related to tweets featuring #coronavirus or something similar may reflect negative sentiment with respect to the state of the virus or with respect to government policies. Similar laguage in two tweets may be expressing nearly opposite viewpoints\n",
    "2. The potential volume of tweets we will be working with will be immense, so subsetting will very likely be required. The basis on which this subsetting is done will influence the set of sentiment we are expossed to. \n",
    "3. We may see little to no relationship between sentiment and number of cases. The response to the virus has been in many cases driven by political leanings, skewing the impact of tweet sentiment based on the source of additional data. "
