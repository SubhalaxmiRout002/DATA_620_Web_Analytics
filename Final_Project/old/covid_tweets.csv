2020-07-08 15:17:53+00:00	The US government has uniquely, and catastrophically, failed to protect its citizens from #COVID19. Now it is forcing parents, children, and workers into dangerous situations. No other democratic nation is treating people so cruelly.
2020-07-08 14:59:32+00:00	Without rapid and robust testing, the infections will continue to spiral. Take it from me, KNOWING you have #COVID19 is very different from THINKING you might have it. One week turnaround on testing unacceptable and contributes to the spread of the virus.

2020-06-29 14:09:01+00:00	It’s not just the #COVID19 cases that are going up. Number of deaths are 10x higher compared to Japan/China/South Korea. When Rt is below 1.0, the virus will stop spreading - it’s below in ~13 of 50 states https://rt.live/ We need to learn from them and do better
2020-06-29 11:49:42+00:00	After the 2019-2021 School Year was greatly disrupted & amidst all the loss & pain caused by #COVID19, NYC’s young people deserve &amp; need #SYEP. Hopefully the Mayor &amp; Council are able to salvage it. Join this march if you can to show them how important this program is.
2020-06-29 04:12:35+00:00	So, I was curious what the US rate for COVID-19 numbers were for the end of June, especially with this huge infection rate in the south/ west, but couldn’t find them online. So I started crunching the numbers... #covid19 #covid #KeepAmericaGreat

2020-06-28 11:21:47+00:00	So many patients (and their families) affected in direct and indirect ways from the pandemic. Hoping NY doesn’t forget the severity of what happened here as we carefully reopen and minimized lives lost both short and long term. #COVID19 
2020-06-28 11:15:54+00:00	That’s why we have to never stop, never surrender. #COVID19 did one good thing it exposed the power of people and the inept but harmful lies of the government. This clash will get worse but in the end we outnumber them. Change, it’s hard not impossible.

2020-06-10 21:43:41+00:00	**NEW** #COVID19 mortality data by race. Black Americans are still the most disproportionately impacted by #COVID19. 1 in 1625 Black Americans have died. If Black Americans had died at the same rate as white Americans, 14,000 Black Americans would be alive today. My god. 
2020-06-10 21:06:41+00:00	Many Americans are moving on but #COVID19 is not. “Members of the D.C. National Guard who were deployed last week in response to the protests over George Floyd’s murder have tested positive.” We don’t know how many, let’s hope they all survive.

2020-06-06 22:15:56+00:00	In February, a black NYC resident would have found a racist NYPD + exclusionary economy.

2020-06-06 19:19:40+00:00	A key takeaway is that tear gas — which attacks the respiratory system — could potentially increase the spread of #COVID19 and make some people more prone to catching it.

2020-06-06 15:52:38+00:00	New York is dramatically beating #COVID19 because of what citizens have done and are doing. We wear masks, respect each other and keep our distance. We not only “flattened the curve, we bent the curve.” We are a model for the country.

2020-06-01 16:44:05+00:00	Glad a discussion is unfolding on #covid19 and safe protesting. It would be a sick irony for Trumpers to weaponize sudden fake concern about this disease to justify harassing, arresting, and killing more people in the streets. But it wouldn’t surprise me at all. 
2020-06-01 15:52:21+00:00	#Covid19 + #NYPD = massacre to black &amp; brown communities. This weekend by far has demonstrated why we need to move away from punitive system(s)an agency filled w/ hate &amp; violence.

2020-06-01 13:55:56+00:00	Exaclty!! ME: the #1 reason our response to #COVID19 was so muddled is that we politically tribalized a national health pandemic. Viruses don’t have political ideologies to promote nor elections to win. 
2020-06-01 12:41:27+00:00	This is true. People are forgetting about #COVID19 in their understandable rage and outrage. Be careful people. The #CoronaVirus is still here. The spike in two weeks will be awful. ##GeorgeFloyd

2020-05-31 16:43:37+00:00	Ok #MedTwitter : I suspect many of us are 1) continuing to fight #COVID19 and yet also 2) about 5 minutes away from taking to the streets in #protests2020. I think it’s up to us to help our allies stay as safe as possible while doing so. Shall we debate guidelines?
2020-05-31 16:32:37+00:00	#riots2020 not a protest anymore. Calling Dr Fauci. What happened to #SocialDistancing and #COVID19? No mask, while screaming spreading covid.

2020-05-31 01:36:35+00:00	Let’s be clear. Black folks were getting killed before #COVID19, they’re getting killed during COVID + sadly will be killed after COVID. Don’t question why folks are outside protesting during a pandemic. Ask yourself what you’re doing about it so that we don’t have to #protests
2020-05-31 01:34:50+00:00	For two months we’ve watched the Black community be devastated by #COVID19. Then we watched George Floyd die with a police officer’s knee on his neck. So we protest police brutality and are met by more police brutality. There is only so much we can be expected to take.

2020-05-22 22:31:48+00:00	Mutual aid and collective care frameworks aren’t practices only to manifest during #COVID19. They also don’t begin and end with wealth redistribution and food justice work. What separates mutual aid from charity is political consciousness and keeping each other safe.
2020-05-22 22:31:48+00:00	As we push governments to fund critical programs and enact just, livable policies to address needs of people on the margins, like single mother families, we’ve got to step into long-term community care.

2020-05-11 18:15:12+00:00	Gov. Cuomo said that among the first businesses opening on Friday will be drive-in movies. So instead of May 15, the state is reopening in the 1960s. #Cuomo #NYS #COVID19
2020-05-11 17:00:59+00:00	Devastating. Nursing homes, residential care settings, and their residents and workers deserve priority, targeted support to survive this crisis. It’s a matter of life and death. #COVID19 @ASAging @ConsumerVoices @PHInational

2020-05-11 14:22:05+00:00	Important warning from @UNAIDS and @WHO. Time to act is now. We can’t play global health whack-a-mole with infectious diseases. #HIV prevention and treatment services must be supported alongside the #COVID19 response.

2020-05-11 17:20:14+00:00	I don’t understand why, especially during #COVID19, some stores choose ship multiple items one by one in separate deliveries from 1 online purchase? I ordered 6 items from 1 store and the store has been sending each item out day by day! Why not send out in 1 shipment when ready?!

2020-05-11 11:14:07+00:00	.@DavidLat’s thread has lots of useful details. But I agree the #COVID19 era means it’s time to make the household oximeter a thing - alongside the thermometer and first aid kit.

2020-05-10 22:08:14+00:00	#COVID19 does not discriminate or respect national borders. We must actively prevent it from being used to stigmatize, marginalize and persecute others. Now, more than ever, the international community must uphold universal human rights. 
2020-05-10 22:04:25+00:00	It’s worth remembering that there are cities that are far denser than NYC with larger mass transit systems that have been far less affected by #COVID19 Sure density/transit are “factors” but those aren’t the reasons.

2020-04-28 14:02:11+00:00	I just heard a Swedish professor, defending the #SwedishModel, justify the higher #COVID19 fatality rates in Sweden by saying “yes, but the deaths are concentrated in the elderly and immigrant communities.” We have a lot of work to do to combat #ageism and #racism in Europe.

2020-04-26 22:33:19+00:00	That 5G is responsible for #COVID19. That we shouldn’t trust any vaccine. 
2020-04-26 22:02:52+00:00	Is @TheRevAl in charge of the spelling on his own chyron?.. #COVID19 
2020-04-26 21:59:07+00:00	We at @ObamaDems join @ERDCNYC, @CODA_LES &amp; many of our sister Democratic clubs &amp; progressive organizations in calling on New York State to allow voters to participate in the Democratic Presidential primary on June 23. We need more democracy coming out or #COVID19, not less. 
2020-04-26 21:51:50+00:00	Sad to see these hashtags trending in Spain as HCW on #COVID19 frontlines testify to the high toll they have suffered due to lack of #PPE &amp; poor decisions made by authorities. #NeitherHeroesNorMartyrs #MareaBlancaCoronavirus #NiHeroesNiMartires #BastaYa
2020-04-26 21:30:27+00:00	Cannot agree more. People have lost their patience and there are many who are resuming life as usual. This will have an impact on healthcare system that has been furloughing doctors and nurses because of low volumes. We could be heading for a collision that is foreseen. #COVID19 
2020-04-26 20:53:36+00:00	I think many of us are worried about the “2nd wave syndrome.” Everyone did really well initially. Now we are all trying to get back to life immediately. This will not go well IMHO. #COVID19 #NYC
2020-04-26 20:01:08+00:00	One of the toughest nurses I’ve ever worked with has passed away from #COVID19. As an intern, we often clashed, but as a senior resident we would hug on shifts. This virus is a nasty one and is quickly taking away our beloveds. Sending love to her family - both blood and chosen.

2020-04-26 14:56:06+00:00	There is a phenomenon with #COVID19 of ‘silent hypoxia’ meaning patients’ blood oxygen levels can be quite low before they feel short of breath. Given your brother has asthma, he should have his blood oxygen level checked with a pulse oximeter. Below 93% level is worrisome.
2020-04-26 14:23:09+00:00	Before any rumors start, I have #COVID19 (headache, fever, fatigue, etc.). Minor so far and better this AM. If anyone sells $mko.v because of this, you can GFY If anyone BUYS $mko.v because of this, you can GFY x 2 No personal contact with anyone at $mko.v since late Feb.

2020-04-26 12:18:52+00:00	Inequities in our health system have only been thrown in to sharper relief by #COVID19. In times of shortage rationing, privileged, well-connected institutions can make an end-run to get what they need, while poor hospitals have to improvise and make do.

If there is anything this pandemic has taught me — it’s how much I love &amp; value human connection. 
2020-04-24 17:27:27+00:00	My patients’ stories about surviving #COVID19 are inspiring &amp; unsettling. Many are @NYCTSubway workers who got sick b4 #PPE was required at work. One told me today they were explicitly told *not* to wear masks initially, but their union fought for them.
2020-04-24 16:33:31+00:00	It’s beyond the pale for an administration to try to limit access to health care in the middle of a worldwide pandemic. Then again the Trump administration stands out for its disregard for human life as well as the safety, health and well-being of anyone who is an other. #COVID19

2020-04-24 17:48:43+00:00	You are right @jonorcutt, this is a time when we have to think outside the box. Amidst the #COVID19 pandemic we must implement measures that will help save lives now and going forward. 
2020-04-24 17:00:28+00:00	Many low-income communities of color suffer from health conditions that make them especially vulnerable to #COVID19. As @CMPeterKoo pointed out, opening streets will ensure that NYers have the opportunity to regularly exercise during this time to remain healthy.

2020-04-23 03:18:22+00:00	The 21 day time constant is not a surprise, it is roughly the time from exposure to incubation to (sadly) death - but this reveals closing non-essential businesses has a measurable impact on the spread of the virus. Social distancing *works* in stopping #COVID19 spread. 
2020-04-23 01:53:47+00:00	If I track daily deaths at a place starting the date when non-essential businesses were shutdown, like clockwork 3 weeks later #COVID19 deaths start going down. These are 4 different places but almost the *exact* same curve.

2020-04-15 12:55:50+00:00	Trick question – #KingTrump is not handling #COVID19, COVID19 is handling him.
2020-04-15 12:34:16+00:00	Ok this is a bit embarrassing but I’m sharing with you as I hope it will put all things in some kind of perspective and remind you to breathe #COVID19 #coronavirus #TrumpPressConf #Covid_19
2020-04-15 04:05:24+00:00	“It is my belief that the World Health Organization must be supported, as it is absolutely critical to the world’s efforts to win the war against #COVID19. This virus is unprecedented in our lifetime and requires an unprecedented response.” @antonioguterres

2020-04-15 02:05:07+00:00	The reality of the #COVID19 pandemic is that my patients have lost all faith in our healthcare system so even when they are very short of breath or have low oxygen levels they refuse to go to the ER bc they’re afraid they will die in a corner and they would rather die at home.
2020-04-15 01:14:03+00:00	We can only defeat #COVID19 if we defeat it everywhere - that requires a global effort. That’s why has announced a $252 million package to help @UN @WHO @wfp @IFRC @UNICEF @UNFPA. Our total contribution is now $939 million, making one of the biggest international donors.

2020-04-14 23:55:44+00:00	The one thing breaking the eerie silence of @newyorkcity these days is the loud 7pm cheers &amp; honks for HCWs (as heard from my 37th floor!). Sure lifts our spirits! But let’s also spare a for all the families praying from home for their ones inside our hospitals #COVID19 
2020-04-14 23:31:07+00:00	It’s been clear there’s an undercounting of the human cost of #COVID19 because of people who passed at home or couldn’t get tested. Now we have numbers. Over 10,000 people have lost their lives in NYC, a rise of 3,700. We need to acknowledge that loss and work to limit more.

Climate change is & will disrupt everything- #COVID19 is a test run for our ability to support radical self-management

2020-04-14 14:16:40+00:00	You're saying you can't walk and chew gum at the same time? During the month of February, Trump held rallies and went golfing. @SenateGOP did absolutely nothing to stem tide of #COVID19. Can't wait to see voters put you into retirement this November.
2020-04-14 13:56:45+00:00	Every April all around the world people gather together to commemorate the genocide in Rwanda, Cambodia & Armenia. As we shelter in place & demagogues try to use the #COVID19 pandemic to divide humanity, let’s learn the lessons of history.

2020-04-14 01:16:10+00:00	It’s safe to say that anyone interested in “re-opening” America in a mere few weeks has *never* cared for a sick patient with #COVID19. Otherwise, they would be shaken to the very core of their being. #StayHomeSaveLives
2020-04-14 00:00:10+00:00	Again:Black folks are not vectors or ‘superpredators’ for COVID;being black is not a risk http://factor.As @doccrearperry coined ‘race is not a risk factor, racism is’. Structural racism produces inequities overall vulnerability to illness vulnerability to #COVID19
2020-04-14 23:16:45+00:00	It’s been a month since #COVID19 was declared a National Emergency, bringing #Manhattan &amp; #NYC to a grinding halt. 31 days of New Yorkers adapting to surroundings &amp; dealing w/ the circumstances at hand.

2020-04-14 11:47:56+00:00	The #COVID19 is humbling the West because we basically know nothing about it, and won’t for some time (years), and we don’t want to admit the fact that we don’t know what to do. Instead, we want to shift blame for not acting on (1) lies from China &amp; (2) unknown information.

2020-04-14 04:11:33+00:00	So a massive swine virus from industrial-scale animal ag led to more demand for animal protein from non-industrial sources which led to #COVID19. How does that negate the argument that our treatment of animals put us in this mess?

2020-04-13 20:01:43+00:00	One of the worst feelings has been having discussions with patients who want #coronavirus testing but being unable to test them bc of limited supplies and bc they don’t fit high-risk #COVID19 criteria but you know the best public health intervention is to test *everyone*...sigh.
2020-04-13 19:09:00+00:00	Pres. @EmmanuelMacron has concluded his speech by emphasizing all the uncertainties surrounding #COVID19 which make difficult any decision making process.
2020-04-13 19:05:05+00:00	I read a lot of sarcastic European comments about the handling of #COVID19 by the US. It’s neither better nor worse than what has been or is happening in Italy, Spain, France, the UK etc. Same shortages, same controversies, same political recuperation...
2020-04-13 18:41:15+00:00	Let’s create a unified brand to label all that relates to #COVID19 response &amp; use these six icons on key messages - personal hygiene, physical distancing, know the symptoms, myth busting, spread kindness &amp; solidarity.

2020-04-13 11:03:21+00:00	*Very* uncomfortable with @CDCgov’s return-to-work guidelines after seeing #COVID19-positive patients with 2-3 weeks of fluctuating symptoms. Most can’t return to work 7 days after symptom onset w/ no fever for 3 days. Bad for patient and coworkers. 
2020-04-13 02:58:21+00:00	With everyone just trying to survive the present, we’re temporarily talking less about our longer-term goals.

2020-04-07 17:26:18+00:00	Thinking about the deep physical + emotional deprivation that’s a part of this crisis. Miss hugging people? Going places? Sex? It may feel like so long since those last interactions.. Can you imagine that feeling in a cage? Many have before #COVID19. Now can we #HALTSolitary? pic.twitter.com/bGrY7tit39
2020-04-07 16:37:13+00:00	Only patients who were tested for #COVID19 would be reported in the COVID death count. At most NYC hospitals, only patients being admitted are tested. The death toll is far higher than what is being reported. 
2020-04-07 15:51:35+00:00	Masks alone are not effective. If you wear one and come too close to someone with #COVID19 and they sneeze you will catch it. Masks are an added layer of protection. Even with a mask you have to maintain the 6ft between you and any person when you are outside.

2020-04-07 14:41:55+00:00	The idea that spring break needed to be canceled in order to keep kids engaged, and not spreading #COVID19 assumes #remotelearning is actually engaging. For many students, it’s not. @BrianLehrer @AGZimmerman @ByJessicaGould
2020-04-07 14:39:07+00:00	I share the assessment of @RichardHaass Excluding the unpredictable effect of a major economic crisis, #COVID19 will reinforce existing trends but not create news. Protectionnism, nationalism, power politics, illiberalism etc.

2020-04-07 02:01:49+00:00	Waiting until people are sick to offer them isolation rooms is an entirely inadequate approach. @NYCMayor &amp; @NYGovCuomo need to adapt a proactive &amp; preventative approach to protect homeless New Yorkers from contracting &amp; spreading #COVID19. The alternative is too devastating.
2020-04-07 01:59:21+00:00	More silver linings: we know more people understand what epidemiologists do now, but now more people know what an “infiltrate” is, and the basics of X-ray interpretation! #COVID19 coverage now offers a crash course in public health &amp; medical literacy @drsanjaygupta @ChrisCuomo
2020-04-07 01:58:22+00:00	Things have gotten worse. 11 homeless New Yorkers have died from #COVID19. 239 shelter residents have tested positive across 93 shelters &amp; 11 people on the streets have tested positive.

2020-04-06 22:54:00+00:00	Each state should be mandated to release their racial and ethnic demographic data ASAP on who has been tested, diagnosed with and dies from #COVID19.

2020-04-05 19:33:47+00:00	When the president says there will be a lot of death, it’s here. New York’s hospitals are already overwhelmed. This scene isn’t from the back alley - it’s a suburban Brooklyn street at 3.59pm. We saw body after body ravaged by #COVID19 All would have died alone. 
2020-04-05 18:43:45+00:00	Hideous, hateful human beings like @Franklin_Graham are the reason our hospitals and funeral homes are filling up. #COVID19

2020-04-05 17:17:51+00:00	Much like @DrOniBee posted “social distancing is a social determinant health” so is the ability to wear “cloth face coverings” or any type public PPE. #BiasInBiasOut #COVID19 
2020-04-05 17:07:02+00:00	Just found out my elder cousin passed last night from #COVID19 in Metro Detroit. His close family could not be with him. Just a last FaceTime to say their words and show their love while he was intubated. Hurts.

2020-04-05 16:50:13+00:00	.@RitchieTorres, chair of the Oversight + Investiagations Committee, has recovered from #COVID19 w. thoughts on assessing the city’s response: “The City Council needs to examine what went wrong.” My story via @Gothamist here:
2020-04-05 15:54:42+00:00	We need serologic testing ASAP to identify HCW who were infected but asymptomatic - this would suggest immunity & safe to work without risk of exposing patients colleagues & family #COVID19 
2020-04-05 14:22:45+00:00	Let me be clear. Racism *not* race is the risk factor for the over-representation of Black #COVID19 cases and mortality in the US. Structural racism thru practices and policies have left Black people and our communities the most vulnerable. We are in a crisis within a crisis.
2020-04-05 12:11:07+00:00	Beautiful Sunday Morning. Horrible virus. As I walk to the hospital I notice flowers now blossoming in trees in front of the UN. My interpretation- Globally #WeAreInThisTogether and we WILL get through this storm. #COVID19 #Hope

2020-04-05 14:49:44+00:00	Another spot on thread by @michaelharriot. There is no “injecting” of race during #COVID19. Race is one of the greatest determinants of health, education, and freedom in this country. Race is inseparable from quality of life. Data must be racially disaggregated, front &amp; center. 
2020-04-05 14:13:32+00:00	Unfortunately, this is what occurs when a community is neglected for years. The City needs to prioritize the low-income communities of color which are being severely impacted by #COVID19

2020-04-03 19:14:10+00:00	A big thank you for the bday wishes - this year it’s all about fighting #COVID19 and healthcare workers are on the front lines. So I’m asking anyone with a few extra $$to donate to @NYCHealthSystem - below is a link to my fundraiser. https://www.facebook.com/donate/2483639991951302/?fundraiser_source=external_url
2020-04-03 18:53:44+00:00	Anyone who would try and profit off the fear, pain, and suffering of those who are on the front lines battling this epidemic, has no conscience. #COVID19 
2020-04-03 17:12:29+00:00	New Yorkers of more color are disproportionately on the front lines of this pandemic and therefore run a higher risk of exposure to #COVID19. We need to see public data on the impact of this pandemic on communities and people of more color. More: 
2020-04-03 16:39:44+00:00	For the patients I saw who were having trouble breathing last night. For the healthcare workers and hospital staff who are running on fumes. For the ppl who are fighting for their lives and their loved ones. For the soul of our nation. We can do more. We must do more. #COVID19
2020-04-03 16:39:43+00:00	That peace of mind is adding to my healing. But it shouldn’t only be veterans who get that piece of mind. They are folks out there who have #COVID19 and no insurance, who are having difficulties breathing and debating going to the ER for fear of a crippling bill.

2020-04-03 14:11:48+00:00	When I was sick in bed with #COVID19 I got messages from friends in Syria, Afghanistan, Cameroon, Rohingya refugees, etc, saying they were praying for me. They will suffer immensely when full force of virus now hits their countries. We must support them.

2020-04-02 14:36:43+00:00	We should wait a bit before uttering definite conclusions about the geopolitical consequences of #COVID19 I don’t see China on the offensive but rather on the defensive, trying to change a narrative that will be in any case negative at its expense.
2020-04-02 14:04:19+00:00	So we are up to as many as 10M workers losing their employer-provided health insurance, during the #COVID19 pandemic. Meanwhile, Joe Biden is campaigning hard on protecting that system and crushing #MedicareForAll.

2020-04-01 00:08:49+00:00	Is he mixing up talking points, again? Did he understand the devastating #Covid19 impact from the beginning? Or, did impeachment hearings drain his time and he therefore couldn't get up to speed on Coronavirus? Which is it: on top of it all along, or preoccupied by unfair Dems?

2020-03-31 21:47:32+00:00	The most unsettling feature of the US response to the #COVID19 is the absence of a national stay-at-home instruction with populated states without serious confinement.
2020-03-31 21:39:18+00:00	The unusual aggressiveness of the Chinese diplomats maybe as (1) a response to the US one (« chinese virus »), (2) a show of insecurity from a regime whose legitimacy is based on its supposed effectiveness, (3) an attempt to change the narrative of the #COVID19 at their advantage

2020-03-23 15:27:13+00:00	Biggest takeaway? Joe Biden has been ridin’ the fiscal conservative and austerity lane for both his whole life and the whole primary. Now in the face of a #COVID19 meltdown he’s promising the whole laundry list of “free stuff.” #OnlyBernie is credible on these policies.
2020-03-23 14:56:10+00:00	In light of the current #COVID19 pandemic, economic recession, climate crisis, and extreme inequality, we’ll need a massive #GreenStimulus to put millions of Americans back to work. @KateOrff co-signed this letter with colleagues across the design field:

2020-03-23 01:30:06+00:00	As of right now, there is no testing for patients not being admitted for #COVID19 in NYC. telling my patients they can’t get tested has been more mentally taxing than I’ve prepared for.
2020-03-23 01:23:22+00:00	Exactly. Especially in #Gastroenterology we need to be on the lookout for patients presenting with diarrhea who may also have fever, cough, and sore throat as this may be #COVID19

2020-03-23 19:11:10+00:00	From my sister-in-law to my wife, today. People all over this country are scared and hurting. Congress needs to put the working class, poor, elderly, disabled, and the homeless FIRST! Any relief package that is passed should focous in Main Street, not Wall Street. #COVID19 
2020-03-23 17:50:35+00:00	An important start but we need to #CancelRent for all homerenters during #COVID19. The virus doesn’t care if you’re in a private or public home or if you have a job or not. Everyone in NYC is impacted and it will only get worse. Where is @RepMaloney on this?
2020-03-23 16:42:54+00:00	This president has many failings, daily. Amongst the most significant & damaging right now is his continued failure to enforce the #DefenseProductionAct. @realDonaldTrump should have done it weeks ago &amp; his reluctance will cost Americans lives unnecessarily. #COVID19 #coronavirus
2020-03-23 16:23:28+00:00	I thank @CityAndStateNY For doing this interview with me. Now more than ever w/ #COVID19 crisis &amp; w/ #Brooklyn having the highest number of cases in all of NYC, we need to be united. #newleadership #BrooklynUnite #Foward @NYGovCuomo @NYCMayor @BPEricAdams
2020-03-23 16:17:35+00:00	.@antonioguterres appeals for a global ceasefire “put armed conflict on lockdown &amp; focus together on the true fight of our lives.” “Our world faces a common enemy: #COVID19. The virus does not care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith. It attacks all, relentlessly.”
2020-03-23 13:38:07+00:00	Morning, @NYGovCuomo &amp; @NYCMayor we need: Emergency action to address the survival needs of homeless New Yorkers amid #COVID19. 80k people are homeless in NYC. Ppl need housing, food &amp; sanitation. Not policing or jails. #HomelessCantStayHome http://bit.ly/33EgV1v
2020-03-23 11:43:16+00:00	Staying home and physically distancing yourself from others doesn’t mean you can’t connect socially using technology and social media. #NYC #COVID19 let’s #StayAtHome #AloneTogether
2020-03-23 07:14:35+00:00	#WhereIsJoeBiden ? He is involved in the efforts to fight #COVID19 just like he was “involved” during the fight for civil rights. #sarcasm
2020-03-23 05:27:55+00:00	It is realistic to push for the permanent release of thousands of ppl rn. The power exists (clemency power), the mobilization exists (all of us, led by formerly incarcerated elders at @RAPPcampaign &amp; @paroleprepny), &amp; circumstances unequivocally demand it (the #COVID19 pandemic)
2020-03-23 02:46:46+00:00	Today is my 18th day on #COVID19 quarantine. I'm feeling much better, and am able to breathe deeply again. I'm still napping/sleeping a lot, it does feel needed and helpful. I'm looking forward to getting a negative test so I can help in my community.
2020-03-23 02:41:35+00:00	This detailed and thoughtful thread about a resident’s challenging experience working during #COVID19 in Spain. Thank you for sharing with us. 
2020-03-23 02:40:51+00:00	As we extend thanks & appreciation to health workers on the frontline of dealing with #COVID19, let’s also thank all who keep public transport moving, collect garbage, stock &amp; staff supermarkets, receptionists &amp; maintenance workers in buildings, &amp; many more. Thanks a million.
2020-03-23 02:18:17+00:00	Extremely disheartening to see elected officials falling back on crass racist tropes to stigmatize China and people of Chinese descent. Viruses like #COVID19 are common enemies of all mankind, and this crisis calls for unity, not further hatred.
2020-03-23 01:40:25+00:00	3. #COVID19 ´so every person passes it to 3. Now that doesn’t sound like much of a difference but if each of those 3 passes it to 3, and that happens at 10 layers, I have been responsible for infecting 59,000.’ Ergo 1 person at 10 layers can infect: Flu = 14 COVID = 59,000
2020-03-23 00:52:54+00:00	Sad that it has come to this but also so grateful to our friends and neighbors who have offered us their N95 masks & are reaching to their friends for more #COVID19 #PPENow #StayAtHome #FlattenTheCurve #needPPE

Can someone in govt please confirm if this is true and if so act quickly to release millions of masks now! #COVID19 
2020-03-22 17:36:37+00:00	Trump knew about #COVID19 IN JANUARY + DID NOTHING. He rejected widespread testing in order to protect his image. He has made clear over + over again that he will put all of our lives at risk for his own gain. Now, he wants us to blame China to distract from his own failings.

2020-03-17 00:54:44+00:00	I have to give big compliments to @Amtrak for handling the #COVID19 situation so well thus far. With the transition to a Sat schedule my trips were rebooked automatically within 10mins of the original time and there's enough room for everyone to spread out. Staff have been great!
2020-03-17 00:54:29+00:00	I tweeted yesterday that everyone should try to support their local bookstore (online). I chose @BronxRiverBooks . I think another worthy cause is your local food bank. I gave money to #FeedingWestchester. Only a few dollars buys a lot of meals. #COVID19
2020-03-17 00:43:48+00:00	A #CPAC attendee who met hundreds of people has tested positive for #COVID19. Those people went on and met thousands and thousands of people. CPAC ended 15 days ago. Not one additional confirmed case from #CPAC attendees. What does that tell you?
2020-03-17 00:41:14+00:00	Putting up a sign today that our doors will be temporarily closed hurt my soul. Thankfully most of what we do can be done via the phone and internet and it’s all in the effort to help stop the spread of #COVID19 ..I can’t imagine the businesses that can’t do the same remotely

2020-03-15 03:08:07+00:00	I’ve always felt that Twitter is the news, curated (for better or worse) by the user and that it skews 2-5 days ahead of cable news. In the case of #Covid19 (because of Wuhan, S. Korea, Italy and Iran) this story skewed 2-3 weeks ahead, and so here we are.

2020-03-04 17:06:45+00:00	Getting prepared on #Corona: @florian_krammer updates a packed audience at @IcahnMountSinai on #COVID19 
2020-03-04 16:56:22+00:00	“There is now a total of 92,943 reported cases of #COVID19 globally, and 3,160 deaths,” said @WHO Director-General @DrTedros today “119 countries have not detected any cases. And of the 75 countries with cases, 47 have 10 cases or less.”
2020-03-04 16:10:27+00:00	Ummmm.... isn’t it 120+ confirmed cases with 9 deaths in the US? This is why we can’t trust this administration. #coronavirus #Covid19 
2020-03-04 14:58:51+00:00	#Breaking - Westchester man, wife, son, daughter and neighbor confirmed to have #CoronaVirus. Manhattan woman also has illness. Six cases total in NYC. #COVID19
2020-03-04 13:17:56+00:00	Thinking of all my friends in Italy. #CoronaVirusitaly #COVID19 
2020-03-04 12:42:06+00:00	The WHO has announced a global death rate of 3.4% for #COVID19 which is significantly higher than #flu. However, this is likely still overestimated as many people who are asymptomatic or with mild symptoms are undiagnosed. #WednesdayWisdom #CoronaAlert

2020-03-03 18:07:11+00:00	We can't afford to fall behind in testing for #COVID19 and thankfully we’re able to do so locally. We’ve quickly confirmed a second case of #coronavirus. I look forward to hearing more about prevention and testing methods at Thursday's @NYCCouncil hearing.
2020-03-03 17:29:25+00:00	Latest guidance regarding schools. It’s all online. I’m confident in the capabilities of @nycHealthy and the NYS Dept of Health to respond to this.

2020-03-03 15:32:21+00:00	I wonder if there’s a way for @nytimes &amp; other news organizations to filter some of these ads amidst #COVID19 #coronavirus.

2020-03-03 13:55:53+00:00	Wondering now if the crazy creationist Christianity of Pence, Pompeo et al is impeding the scientific response to #Covid19 since they don't believe in natural selection, mutation--vaccines, by this logic--etc.
2020-03-03 13:40:29+00:00	This is good. Of course, if we had #Medicare4All this would be a non-issue &amp; we wouldn't be risking spreading #COVID19 because people couldn't afford care.

2020-03-03 01:00:00+00:00	Big deal- imagine someone walking around with #COVID19 who can’t afford testing 
2020-03-03 00:55:18+00:00	Lol. Who’s to say he didn’t or doesn’t get sick of staying up, becoming irresponsible and goes to the grocery store. Again, NYC’s population is 8.4 million... bottom line, if people are displaying symptoms, they should be tested for #COVID19, no matter age or severity.
2020-03-03 00:53:53+00:00	Lol. Ok. You have no idea if he is or if he isn’t. There are 8,398,748 people in NYC. If he took a Lyft/Uber/Taxi home that day, which he did, he left his “germs” in that vehicle. #COVID19 can live up to 9 days on inanimate surfaces. He &amp; everyone with symptoms must be tested. 
2020-03-03 00:50:46+00:00	No. A test is NOT irrelevant!!! If he is positive for #COVID19, he is a carrier for the vulnerable!!! Wow. You really believe if a person is sick, but not vulnerable or dying, a test is irrelevant??!! Then the numbers will be completely skewed. A test is ESSENTIAL!
2020-03-03 00:49:11+00:00	This link to BNO News actually does correspond with the #WHO data I’m using. They’re actually a very reputable, factual news site from The Netherlands. It’s funny. At Trump’s news conference, he said 22 cases in the US. WHO said 68 at that time. #COVID19 #Coronavirus.

2020-03-02 02:50:36+00:00	I think everyone needs to measure their response to #COVID19 a bit. It’s completely ok to be cautious. Please, look out for you and yours. Wash your hands, etc. Don’t freak out though. In our neighborhood peeps are already raiding the groceries. STOP IT. Take a breath.
